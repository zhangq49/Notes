# First Weekly Report

***By Zhang Qi***



#### Working Situation For This Week

The members and structure of our team in this comprehensive training have changed because of withdrawing of some of the original members. So the primary task for this week was to construct a new team and choose one project from the given three projects. Lacking basic knowledgement of cloud computing, I've been went through a difficult time getting myself started in the area of cloud computing.

Having got some basic idea of cloud computing, I started to follow what the teacher assistant taught us to do. During the past week, I've learnt the following fundamental concepts and ideas.

1. Basic Knowledge of Cloud Computing
   * What is Cloud Computing?
   * Why do we need Cloud Computing?
   * What technologies does Cloud Computing have?
   * What is the service model of Cloud Computing?
   * How to implement Cloud Computing?
2. Basic Knowledge of OpenStack
   * The Conceptual Framework of OpenStack
   * The Core System Framework of OpenStack
   * The Fundamental Logic Modules of OpenStack
   * The Virtualization Technology in OpenStack
   * How to Deploy OpenStack on Server

Having made some efforts to get basic ideas of Cloud Computing and OpenStack, we got to discuss which project to choose. Because of little knowledgement of other technologies used together with Cloud Computing and OpenStack, we finally chose the project - The construction of experimental platform for the processing of big data base on cloud platform. After that, we have done some work on the implementation of this platform and got a clue. We organized our project document, and thought we could started up our project. However, the next day we were told to change our project because we've chosen the same project as the other team's. Fortunately, the teacher assistant helped with us to choose another project, and we sincerely appriciated for that.

#### Problems Encountered

1. Unfamiliar with some basic operations on linux

   Surf the Internet and search the usage of those operations.

2. Can't Install OpenStack on Mac

   That is because OpenStack only supports the virtualization technology of linux such as KVM and Xen, which is not implemented on Mac. Hence I had to give up install it on my computer, instead I install it on the virtual machine on the server which is for our team's using.

3. The Windows 7 could't startup normally and went into Blue Screen problem after I've successfully uploaded the Windows 7 image on the OpenStack Server.

   There is something wrong with the server construction.

4. The operating system uploaded on the OpenStack running really slowly.

   The configuration of the OpenStack Server is unable to keep pace with the running operating system.

#### Working Plan For Next Week

Because we've change our project to the Monitored Control System of Cloud Platform, we have to learn more unfamiliar technologies which is relevant to our project.

I have to get a general idea of the following concepts.

1. What is ZooKeeper?
2. What is the application of ZooKeeper?
3. What is the advantages of ZooKeeper?
4. What are the roles of cluster in ZooKeeper?
5. What is session in ZooKeeper?
6. What is Znode in ZooKeeper?
7. What is version in ZooKeeper and what are the differences between the version concepts in ZooKeeper and other version concepts?
8. What is the role of watcher?
9. How to use ACL authority controlling?

Having these basic ideas, I am able to construct cluster using ZooKeeper and gain general thoughts on how to implement the System.
