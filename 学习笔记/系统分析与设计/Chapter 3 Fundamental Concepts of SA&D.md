# Chapter 3 Fundamental Concepts of SA&D

#### Object Technology

* What Is Object Technology

  * abstraction, encapsulation,polymorphism

* The Strengths of Object Technology

  * Reflects a single paradigm
  * Facilitates architectural and code reuse
  * Reflects real world models more closely
  * Encourages stability
  * Is adaptive to change

* Difference Between OO and Structured Design Object-orientation(OO)

  * Melds the data and data flow process together early in the lifecycle
  * Has a high level of encapsulation
  * Promotes reuse of code differently
  * Permits more software extensibility

* A Formal Definition of Object

  * An object is an entity with a well-defined boundary and identity that encapsulates state(attributes and relationships) and behavior(operations, methods and state machines).
  * 对象可唯一识别

* Basic Principles of Object Orientation

  * Abstraction

    the essential characteristics

  * Encapsulation

    * Hides implementation from clients
    * Clients depend on interface
    * Improves Resiliency
    * 对客户隐藏实现、客户依赖于接口、提高了弹性

  * Modularity - 模块化

  * Hierarchy - 分层

    * Elements at the same level of the hierarchy should be at the same level of abstraction.

#### Representing Objects in the UML

* Generalization (Inheritance)

  使用已存在的定义做为基础简历新定义的技术

* Package

  A general purpose mechanism for organizing elements into groups

* Polymorphism (多态)

  对于相同的消息，让各个对象产生不同的行为
