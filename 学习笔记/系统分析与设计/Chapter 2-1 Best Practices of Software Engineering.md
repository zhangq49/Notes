## Chapter 2-1 Best Practices of Software Engineering

#### Software development problems

* User or business needs not met
* Requirements not addressed
* Modules not integrating
* Difficulties with maintenance
* Late discovery of flaws
* Poor quality of end-user experience
* Poor performance under load
* No coordinated team effort
* Build-and-release issues

#### The Six Best Practices

* Develop Iteratively (迭代化开发) 
  * 可以尽早降低风险
* Manage Requirements (需求管理)
  * 确认解决正确的问题，构建正确的系统
  * 采用系统化方法捕捉需求、组织需求、书写文档和管理
  * 不断变更的需求
* Use Component Architecture (使用基于构件的体系结构)
  * Resilient(弹性化)
  * Component-based(基于构件)
* Model Visually UML (可视化软件建模)
  * Captures structure and behavior
  * Keeps design and implementation consistent
  * Hides or exposes details as appropriate
  * Promotes unambiguous communication
* Continuously Verify Quality (持续质量验证)
* Manage Change (控制软件变更)
